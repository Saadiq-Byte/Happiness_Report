# World-Happiness Report 2021.


This report presents the results of a data analysis on the 2021 World Happiness Report.
The analysis includes visualizations of key variables such as GDP
per capita, social support, and life expectancy, as well as an
examination of the relationship between these variables and
overall happiness scores. In addition, the report discusses the
limitations of the data and considerations for future research.
Overall, the findings of this analysis provide valuable insights
into the drivers of happiness and the state of well-being
globally.

## Action
I tackled some Data Quality and Tidiness issues in the various datasets gathered. 
After cleaning the dataset, I was able to analyze and visualize insights 
utilizing Excel and Python programming techniques to explore trends 
and patterns in happiness levels around the world.

## Data Analysis Processing

In this Project, I performed the below Data analysis processes to make the data clean and ready for Visualizing.
<ol>
<li>Data Gathering</li>
<li>Data Assessing</li>
<li>Data Cleaning</li>
</ol>

## Quality issues

I tackled the below data quality and tidiness issues in various datasets Gatherd.

<ol>
<li>Kaggel data-enhanced.csv</li>
<li>Country Name colum had invalid names i.e 'None', 'quite' e.tc </li>
<li>Some rows had duplicates Values</li>
<li>Misalined data entires</li>
</ol>

<hr>

After resolving the above issues using data Cleaning (defined, code and test stapes)
Cleaned copies were made and they were imported to Jupyter-note.
The Analysis was then taken a step further to discover some insights.

## Analyzing and Visualizing Data

In this section, using the cleaned datasets, I was able to analyze and vizualize insights below.

## Insights:

<ol>
<li>What regional has the highest Happiness score Vs GDP</li>
<li>By corrolation whis region is the higest</li>
<li>corruption in region</li>
<li>Perception of corruption in various Regions</li>
<li>Top 10 happiest countries Life Expectancy</li>
<li>Bottom 10 least countries Life Expectancy</li>
<li>Freedom to make life choices Vs Happniess Score</li>
<li>Countries with most perception of corruption Vs Corruption Index</li>
<li>Happiness Score Vs Coppuption</li>
</ol>

## Conclustion

Happiness report project was fun. Data Cleaning and filtering is a skill that is needed since so 
much of the world's data isn't clean. Cleaning the dataset prevented me from making mistakes and missing out on important insights.
